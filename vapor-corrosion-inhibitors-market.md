<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapor Corrosion Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anode Inhibitor</li><li>Cathode Inhibitor</li><li>Mixed Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vapor Corrosion Inhibitors are divided into three main types based on their mechanism of action: Anode Inhibitors, Cathode Inhibitors, and Mixed Inhibitors. Anode Inhibitors work by forming a protective film on the metal surface, preventing the oxidation of the metal. Cathode Inhibitors act by neutralizing the cathodic regions on the metal surface, inhibiting the reduction reactions. Mixed Inhibitors combine the effects of both Anode and Cathode Inhibitors to provide comprehensive protection against corrosion. These different types cater to various industries and applications where corrosion protection is essential.</p></p>
