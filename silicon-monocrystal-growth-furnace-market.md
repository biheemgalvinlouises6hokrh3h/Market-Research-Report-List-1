<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Monocrystal Growth Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Czochralski (CZ) Method Furnace</li><li>Floating Zone (FZ) Method Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silicon monocrystal growth furnaces are used in the production of high-quality silicon wafers for semiconductor applications. The Czochralski (CZ) method furnace is the most common type, where a seed crystal is dipped into molten silicon and slowly pulled upwards to create a single crystal. The Floating Zone (FZ) method furnace, on the other hand, uses a high-energy heat source to melt a silicon rod without making contact, allowing for higher purity crystals. Both methods play a crucial role in the semiconductor industry.</p></p>
