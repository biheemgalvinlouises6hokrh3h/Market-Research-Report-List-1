<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photosensitive Reversible</li><li>Photosensitive Irreversible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photosensitive polymers are divided into two main types: Photosensitive Reversible and Photosensitive Irreversible. Photosensitive reversible polymers undergo reversible changes in their structure when exposed to light, allowing them to return to their original state after being exposed to a specific wavelength of light. On the other hand, photosensitive irreversible polymers undergo permanent changes in their structure when exposed to light, making them suitable for applications where a permanent change is desired. Both types offer unique properties and applications in various industries.</p></p>
