<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dehydrogenation Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Catalyst</li><li>Deactivation Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active catalysts in the dehydrogenation catalyst market are those that are able to facilitate the dehydrogenation process effectively, resulting in a high yield of desired products. On the other hand, deactivation catalysts are substances that inhibit or slow down the dehydrogenation reaction, leading to a decrease in product yield. Active catalysts are crucial for efficient production, while deactivation catalysts can impede the process and result in lower productivity. Both types play a significant role in the overall performance of dehydrogenation processes.</p></p>
