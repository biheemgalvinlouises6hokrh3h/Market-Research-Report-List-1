<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio Jet Fuel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO)</li><li>Fischer Tropsch (FT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio jet fuel market includes two main types: Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Fischer Tropsch (FT). HVO is derived from oils and fats through a hydrogenation process, resulting in a high-quality, drop-in fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel. On the other hand, FT bio jet fuel is produced through the Fischer-Tropsch process, which involves converting biomass or waste materials into liquid hydrocarbons. Both HVO and FT offer sustainable alternatives to traditional jet fuel, helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation industry.</p></p>
