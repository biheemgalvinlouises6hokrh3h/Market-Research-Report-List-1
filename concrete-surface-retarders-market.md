<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Surface Retarders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based</li><li>Solvent-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concrete surface retarders are chemicals used to slow down the setting of concrete to allow for decorative finishes to be applied. There are two main types of concrete surface retarders - water-based and solvent-based. Water-based retarders are environmentally friendly and easy to clean up, making them the preferred choice for many contractors. On the other hand, solvent-based retarders are more durable and resistant to chemicals, making them suitable for harsh environments. Both types of retarders offer different benefits and are used based on specific project requirements.</p></p>
