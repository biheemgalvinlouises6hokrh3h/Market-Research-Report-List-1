<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Insulated PVB Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endothermic Film</li><li>Reflective Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat Insulated PVB Film comes in two main types: Endothermic Film and Reflective Film. Endothermic Film absorbs and dissipates heat energy, preventing it from passing through the glass, making it ideal for use in buildings or vehicles to regulate interior temperature. Reflective Film, on the other hand, reflects heat away from the glass, reducing solar heat gain and improving energy efficiency. Both types of PVB Film offer effective insulation properties, making them popular choices for applications requiring thermal regulation.</p></p>
