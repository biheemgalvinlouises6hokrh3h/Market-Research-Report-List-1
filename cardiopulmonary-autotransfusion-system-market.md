<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unwashed ATS</li><li>Washed ATS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion System (ATS) market includes two types: Unwashed ATS and Washed ATS. Unwashed ATS involves the collection of blood from the patient's surgical site via a suction device. The blood is then filtered and reinfused back into the patient without any additional processing. On the other hand, Washed ATS involves a more rigorous process where the collected blood is cleansed, eliminating impurities and potential contaminants before being reinfused into the patient. Both types serve as effective methods for autotransfusion during surgical procedures, offering benefits such as reduced blood loss and a decreased need for blood transfusions.</p></p>
