<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-cleaning Surfaces Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-cleaning surfaces glass is divided into two main types - hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Hydrophilic surfaces attract water and spread it out to form a thin film, allowing dirt to be easily washed away by rain or water. Hydrophobic surfaces repel water, causing it to form droplets that pick up dirt particles as they roll off the surface. Both types help keep the glass clean and free from streaks, making them ideal for applications where cleanliness is crucial.</p></p>
