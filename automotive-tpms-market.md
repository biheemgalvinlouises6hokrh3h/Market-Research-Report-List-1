<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive TPMS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) is categorized into two types: direct TPMS and indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors within each tire to monitor air pressure levels and alert the driver if there is a significant drop. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, relies on the antilock braking system to detect changes in tire rotation speeds, indicating potential pressure issues. Direct TPMS provides more accurate and real-time data, while indirect TPMS is generally less expensive to implement and maintain.</p></p>
