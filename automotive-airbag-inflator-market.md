<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Gas Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive airbag inflator market includes three main types: pyrotechnic gas inflator, hybrid gas inflator, and stored gas inflator. Pyrotechnic gas inflators use a chemical reaction to rapidly inflate the airbag in case of a collision. Hybrid gas inflators combine compressed gas and pyrotechnic technology for improved performance. Stored gas inflators store gas under high pressure and release it through a valve when needed. Each type offers unique benefits in terms of speed, reliability, and efficiency in deploying airbags during accidents.</p></p>
