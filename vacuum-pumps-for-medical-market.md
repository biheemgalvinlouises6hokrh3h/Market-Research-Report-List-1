<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Pumps for Medical Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum pumps for the medical market are classified into two main types: positive displacement and centrifugal pumps. Positive displacement pumps create a vacuum by displacing a fixed quantity of air, typically using pistons or rotary vanes. These pumps are commonly used in medical applications where a consistent and controlled vacuum is required, such as in surgeries or laboratory work. Centrifugal pumps, on the other hand, generate a vacuum through the centrifugal force created by a rotating impeller. They are often used in medical environments where a continuous flow of vacuum is necessary, like in suction machines or vacuum-assisted wound therapy devices.</p></p>
