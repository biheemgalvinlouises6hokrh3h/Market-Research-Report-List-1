<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Duct Wrap Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Facings</li><li>Without Facings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiberglass duct wrap insulation comes in two main types: with facings and without facings. Duct wrap with facings has a protective outer layer that helps improve durability and moisture resistance. This type is often used in more exposed or outdoor locations. Duct wrap without facings is a more basic option without the added protective layer. It is typically used in indoor applications where moisture resistance is not a primary concern. Both types offer effective thermal insulation for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.</p></p>
