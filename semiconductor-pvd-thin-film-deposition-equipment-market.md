<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor PVD Thin Film Deposition Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum Evaporation</li><li>Sputtering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor PVD Thin Film Deposition Equipment market includes two main types - Vacuum Evaporation and Sputtering. Vacuum Evaporation involves heating a material in a vacuum until it evaporates and then allowing it to condense onto a substrate. Sputtering, on the other hand, involves bombarding a target material with high-energy ions to dislodge atoms, which then deposit on a substrate. Both methods are widely used in the semiconductor industry for depositing thin films with precise thickness and composition for various applications.</p></p>
